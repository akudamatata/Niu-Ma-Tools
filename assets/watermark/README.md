# Watermark Assets

Place the exported PNG assets from the 今日水印 template in this directory before running the generator.

Required files:

- `logo.png` – the "今日水印" logo with transparent background.
- `separator.png` – the yellow vertical separator bar.

You can generate these PNGs from the provided PSD or reuse the design assets supplied alongside the project. Keep the filenames identical to the list above so the Python module can locate them automatically.
